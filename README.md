# flutter_facebook_image_picker

> Flutter plugin that allows you to display Facebook multi image picker on iOS and Android.

## Getting started

This plugins displays a gallery with user's Facebook Albums and Photos, based on the access token provided. The plugin does not handle authorozation and login by itelf. In order to do that and provide access token you can use a plugin like [flutter_facebook_login](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_facebook_login), and then just provide the access token to the gallery.

For a complete exaple see the example app.

## Theming and localization

You can customize different parts of the gallery picker. For reference see below the available options for the different platforms:
